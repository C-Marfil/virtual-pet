<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->
This project takes place within our OOP module, in which we become very comfortable working with objects within objects, methods that modify objects and passing objects as other objects' arguments and properties.

At the moment, in the repo, you can find the code for the pet to work. You have to manually input the method that makes our pet age, and any other method, through the console. However, I am currently working on implementing Intervals and a GUI for the pet, including a general visual identity for the product.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Your pet will die at 30 years old - like we all did.

It will also die if hunger reaches 10 or fitness reaches 0.

This is a list of the methods you can call to control the pet:
- `growUp` : Ages our pet 1 year, increases hunger by 5 and decreases fitness by 3.
- `walk`: Increases fitness by 4.</li>
- `PTSession`: Increases fitness to its max value (10).
- `feedASnack`: Decreases hunger by 3.
- `feedAPizza`: Decreases hunger by 10.
- `checkUp`: Returns the status of your pet as long as hunger or fitness is within the danger zone.
- `adoptChild`: Our pet will adopt another existing pet as theirs.
- `haveBaby`: Our pet will create another pet, which will become its child.

I am currently retraining at Manchester Codes to start my journey as a Software Developer. Technology has always been an important part of my life, and now I am able to commit my career to it. 

If you are a potential employer, you should hire me because:

- I have successfully completed Manchester Codes (If you are reading this past March 2023), you can have a look at their curriculum <a href='https://www.manchestercodes.com/why-manchester-codes'>here</a>.
- I enjoy learning, so I always make time for research and keeping updated with this fast-evolving industry.
- I pride myself in learning fast. I absorb complex concepts quickly and in detail.
- I have 6 years of organisational experience; I know how to work with people and foster a company's culture.
